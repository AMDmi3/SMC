Legal Notice for Contributions
==============================

[These are the license terms for artistic contributions to the game
prior to 7th November 2014. They were the contribution licensing terms
of the original SMC game (which TSC is a fork of) and have been
changed by the TSC team per the 7th November 2014. See the README file
for the current licensing terms for artistic content.]

[These terms were copied [from the SMC
wiki](http://www.secretmaryo.org/wiki/index.php?title=Legal_Notice_for_Contributions)
on 7th November 2014.]

Contributions refer to any image, music, sound, level, world or other
data file which are send and to which you own the rights.

Contributions
-------------

Sending any contributions (else if explicitly described not as such)
for this game on the Forum/Wiki/E-Mail is a tacit acceptance of the
fact that you allow the Project Leader complete copyright. You
maintain your own full rights to the contributions, and may continue
to do whatever you wish to do with them.

Please do not post any contributions to which you do not own the
rights, or any derivative work under copyright law. We cannot accept
such works. Such actions are punishable by banning at the first or
second offense, subject to moderator's and administration's judgment.

Fair Use
--------

Work to which you do not hold the rights may be posted under the "fair
use" exemption, but not for the purpose of contribution to this
game. The "fair use" exemption was created to allow things such as
commentary, parody, research and education about copyrighted works
without the permission of the author. Should you make such a
contribution, be sure it's legal and accredit the copyright holder.

Special definition for music
----------------------------

The definition of “source code” refers in the case of music not to
their project source but to the file itself. This means you don't need
to publish the project files of contributed music files.
