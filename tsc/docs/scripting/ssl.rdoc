= TSC Standard Scripting Library

This documentation covers TSCâ€™s standard scripting library (SSL), a
set of ruby files that comes together with TSC. These library files
built upon the core functionalities provided by the TSC {scripting core
API}[http://tscsdocs.quintilianus.eu] and extend it to be more easy to
use. As explained, the SSL is written entirely in Ruby. Its
implementation can be found inside the <tt>data/scripting</tt> folder
of an TSC installation.

== Usage

The libraries from the SSL are not loaded by default, you first have
to explicitely load them into your level script by issueing a line
such as the following:

  TSC.require "std/switch"

This will load the +switch+ library, a wrapper class that makes the
use of Pow switches easier.

If you want to load all of the SSL at once (which might be slow), you
can use:

  TSC.require "std/all"

For the usage of each component of the SSL, refer to its respective
documentation.

== Contributing

The SSL is quite small right now. The TSC team encourages every level
scripter to submit code snippets he uses frequently in his levels to
the {issue tracker}[https://github.com/Secretchronicles/TSC/issues],
so that they can be considered for addition to the SSL in a future
version of TSC.

== License

The SSL and this documentation are licensed under the same conditions
as TSC, unless noted otherwise.
