The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M.
===============================

“The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M.” is a 2D sidecrolling platform game,
with a rich set of graphics, music, and an advanced level editor that
allows you to create your own levels. The level editor allows for
in-game scripting so there are no borders apart from your imagination.

The project is a fork of [SMC](http://www.secretmaryo.org), which is
not developed actively anymore. Note this is not merely a continuation
of SMC, but we have our own goals and design principles we are slowly
integrating into both the codebase and the artwork.
