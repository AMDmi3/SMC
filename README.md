Secret Maryo Chronicles
=======================

What is it?
-----------

From the official website at http://www.secretmaryo.org:

> Secret Maryo Chronicles is an Open Source two-dimensional platform
> game with a design similar to classic computer games. SMC has
> computer support to a great degree by using an accelerated [Open
> Graphics Library](http://opengl.org) for the best possible graphic
> design and stock performance.

It features a wealth of levels, powerups, great music and much more —
see http://www.secretmaryo.org/index.php?page=about for a more
comprehensive list. And for those still not getting enough, it
provides a great in-game level editor.

How to install?
---------------

Releases are published precompiled for Windows at the website. If you
want to compile SMC yourself, please see the INSTALL.md file.
